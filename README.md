Py_LogOff
=========

A logoff utility written in python with Kivy that prompts the user for how long they want to be logged in 
then logs them off after that period of time. Relaunches if the user chooses to close the app. 

If the user does not choose a time, this logs the user off after 1 hour

Compiled win32 binaries can be found at:

http://livinginsyn.com/logoff_binaries/

All the files located in that directory must be placed inside of a folder "c:\uits\" for now.
