Py_LogOff
=========

A logoff utility written in python with Kivy that prompts the user for how long they want to be logged in 
then logs them off after that period of time. Relaunches if the user chooses to close the app. 

If the user does not choose a time, this logs the user off after 1 hour

When the initial time is up, this program asks if they need 5 more minutes. They can select yes up to 3 times. If nothing is entered, this will log the user off automatically after 5 minutes.
